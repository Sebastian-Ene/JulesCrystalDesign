    Jules Crystal Design Jewelry created with soul for beautiful Souls. Delicate
    and elegant, fantasy inspired, one of a kind jewelry made for you as an
    unique experience. About: a.Jewelry: Jules Crystal Design is creating unique
    jewelry that brings you a full magical experience. The pieces are inspired
    from far away realms, mythical creatures and forgotten fairytales. All of
    them are created by hand in different styles in the heart of Transylvania.
    The techniques used in the process of creation are various. This way, we
    always bring new pieces with character and special features. b. Shipping We
    are working from Bucharest, Romania (an small country from Eastern Europe).
    For orders inside Romania, the packages can be sent by post or fast courier
    at the customer’s choice (Shipping costs are not covered in the item’s
    price). For post orders, items arrive in 2-3 days but sometimes delays can
    occur and can get to 7 days. If you opt for courier shipping, you should
    expect you item to arrive in 48 hours. For International Shipping, we are
    shipping worldwide! For Europe orders, the waiting time is around one week.
    For other continents the shipping time is usually 10 days but can get to two
    weeks. But for International customers, the only shipping option is by post.
    How long does it take to ship it? Usually for intern post orders it takes
    around two days. We usually ship it the day after the order was confirmed
    but there can be exceptions. At certain items, there is a higher processing
    time since the item is probably remade especially for that order, so there
    might be a few days added. I always mention the waiting time after
    confirming an order. For courier orders, I usually send the orders in the
    same day the order was made or the day after. For International orders I
    usually ship once a week or twice a week. You should know that once the
    orders is sent from me, I am no longer responsible for the shipping. Clients
    that don’t pick up orders will be banned from further orders, since I have
    to cover the full shipping for both ways and the deposit taxes. How can I
    pay? Only for intern orders you can pay when the item is shipped through
    courier or post. There are also 2 more options: Bank Transfer and PayPal
    that are available for International customers too. c.Custom Orders I
    usually take custom orders. You can reach me out on Instagram, email or even
    online shop. You can tell me how do you visualize you jewelry, we can
    further discuss it together and tell you if I can do it or nor. The prices
    will be set before I start working considering the amount of work, materials
    and difficulty. After everything is set, the customer will have to pay in
    advance 50% on the item’s full price through PayPal or Bank Transfer. The
    full price will be payed after the item is finished either when the item is
    shipped or before through Bank Transfer or PayPal. About Us (Get to know us)
    My name is Iulia and I am the creator of what you see. I am currently an
    Interior Architecture at Ion Mincu University of Architecture from
    Bucharest. I am a lover of nature and my world revolves around mountain
    hikes, architecture and jewelry . I started this handmade journey 5 years
    ago when I saw my mom creating rustic wood painted necklaces and I realize
    that I can also give it a try. In the beginning I was really young and
    clueless therefore I had so many fails. Until October 2018 I only keep
    loosing money because I was investing so much but had 0 orders. Until I
    finally made my Instagram account and opened my Breslo shop. And since then
    people started to get to know my jewelry and my community is growing slowly
    but surely. At the beginning of 2020 I started my Etsy shop and shipped to
    many countries such as Germany, Australia, US or France. Jules Crystal
    Design is my vision of breaking free from all the ordinary daily jewelry and
    seeking the paramountey. I am dreaming my creation and then I create my
    dream. Since I love my pieces to be one of a kind, I spend hours seeking
    high-quality materials and look for unique and beautiful stones and
    crystals. I almost never buy them online because I like to hand-pick them so
    they have the most awesome colors and reflections. As a small business
    owner, design and sketch my jewelry and then create it. All photos are
    taken, edited and modeled by me. Sometimes my sisters help me with this
